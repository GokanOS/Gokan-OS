## Gokan OS (五環)

Gokan OS is an open design framework for re-architecting planetary-scale infrastructure as a single circulatory system.

It is **not** a product.
It is **not** a policy.
It is **not** a prediction.

It is a set of **design principles and system architectures** for reconnecting fragmented elements of civilization into coherent, regenerative circulation.


## What is Gokan OS?

Modern infrastructure treats water, soil, air, energy, fire, and human activity as **separate optimization problems.**

Gokan OS starts from a different premise:

> The world is not a collection of isolated systems.
> It is a set of interconnected states forming a single circulation.

Gokan OS reframes infrastructure not as assets to control, but as **states to connect.**



## The Five OS Layers

Gokan OS consists of five independent but interoperable operating systems:

## Water OS

Reframes water not as a liquid to transport, but as a **phase-changing information medium.**
Focuses on humidity, evaporation, pressure differentials, and condensation to restore water circulation without energy-intensive transport.

## Soil OS

Redefines soil not as a static material, but as a **circulating living layer.**
Focuses on recreating environmental conditions for autonomous microbial regeneration instead of chemical inputs.

## Wind OS

Treats wind not as a phenomenon to generate, but as a **state that emerges from pressure differences.**
Focuses on designing circulation conditions for air, heat, and humidity at architectural and urban scales.

## Fire OS

Reframes combustion not as an accident or destructive event, but as a **chain state** formed by connected conditions.
Focuses on designing systems where unsafe connections cannot persist.

## Thunder OS

Redefines energy not as something to generate, but as **ambient fluctuation to be captured and translated.**
Focuses on vibration, shock, displacement, and electromagnetic variation as recoverable states.

> Each OS is fully independent.
> Connections between OSs are **intentional but non-prescriptive.**



## Design Philosophy

Gokan OS is based on the following principles:
-	Circulation over control
-	States over resources
-	Conditions over commands
-	Distributed design over centralized optimization
-	Reframing problems instead of “solving” them

It uses **only fundamental physical principles.**
No speculative physics, no proprietary technology assumptions.



## Open ORISIN Protocol

All Gokan OS materials are released as an **open design framework.**
-	No patents
-	No exclusivity
-	No central authority
-	Free to implement, modify, and extend

Anyone may build upon these designs without permission.



## This Repository

This repository serves as the **structural index** for the Gokan OS ecosystem.

Primary materials are hosted on external platforms:
-	**OSF (canonical papers, English & Japanese PDFs)**
https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/NQ98Z
-	**NotebookLM (AI-assisted interactive reading)**
https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/fbb1ed78-fa18-4379-b531-66c79f4b6e6a
-	**Notion (human-readable Japanese overview)**

This GitHub repository intentionally contains **minimal code.**

It exists to:
-	Anchor implementations
-	Enable forks and derivatives
-	Provide a neutral coordination point



## How to Engage

You do not need to fully understand Gokan OS to engage with it.

Questions, partial understanding, and exploratory interpretations are welcome.

If you are interested in:
-	Implementing part of an OS
-	Connecting it to an existing system
-	Challenging assumptions constructively

You are encouraged to participate.



## Community

Discussion and circulation happen here:

**Discord**
https://discord.gg/KSM9ug85m

This is not a support forum.
It is a space for shared inquiry and system-level thinking.



## Final Note

Gokan OS does not claim to save the world.

It proposes a way to **see it differently.**

If civilization is stuck, perhaps the problem is not lack of technology,
but lack of shared coordinates.

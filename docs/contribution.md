# Contributing to Gokan OS

Gokan OS is an open design framework.
It does not aim for correctness, completeness, or consensus.

Contribution is not about optimizing solutions.
It is about expanding the shared coordinate system.


---

## Who Can Contribute

Anyone.

You do not need:
- formal credentials
- full understanding of all OSs
- implementation experience

Partial understanding is acceptable.
Questions are valid contributions.


---

## What Counts as a Contribution

Contributions include, but are not limited to:

- Conceptual extensions or critiques
- Reframing an OS in a different domain
- Mapping Gokan OS to an existing system
- Identifying contradictions or edge cases
- Proposing alternative interpretations
- Implementing a partial or experimental design
- Writing, translation, or documentation improvements

Silence followed by careful thought
is also a valid form of engagement.


---

## What This Is *Not*

This project is not:

- A product roadmap
- A startup pitch
- A policy proposal
- A prediction of the future
- A request for consensus

Do not treat Gokan OS as something to "win" or "prove."


---

## Principles for Contribution

When contributing, please prioritize:

- Curiosity over certainty
- Reframing over refuting
- Exploration over optimization
- Circulation over control

Avoid:
- dismissal without engagement
- evaluation without context
- reduction to single metrics
- premature feasibility judgments


---

## On Implementation

Implementation is welcome,
but **implementation is not the goal**.

If you build something:
- describe the assumptions you made
- describe which OS you are interpreting
- describe what you intentionally ignored

Implementation is a form of reading.


---

## Forks and Derivatives

Forks are encouraged.

You may:
- rename concepts
- isolate specific OSs
- combine with unrelated systems
- discard parts you disagree with

Please preserve attribution to Gokan OS
as a reference coordinate when applicable.

## Communication

Discussion happens primarily in Discord:

https://discord.gg/KSM9ug85m

This is not a support channel.
It is a shared inquiry space.

Long-form discussion is preferred
over reactive commentary.

## Final Note

You are not expected to agree with Gokan OS.

You are invited to think with it.

If something feels unclear,
that may be a feature—not a flaw.

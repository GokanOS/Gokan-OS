# Gokan OS — OS Map

This document describes how the five operating systems of Gokan OS
relate to each other as circulating states.

This is not a dependency graph.
It is a relational map.


---

## The Five OS as States

Gokan OS consists of five independent operating systems:

- Water OS
- Soil OS
- Wind OS
- Fire OS
- Thunder OS

Each OS represents a domain of the world,
but more importantly, each represents a **type of state**.

They are not stacked layers.
They are overlapping, interacting circulations.

## Core State Domains

### Water OS — Phase State
Water OS governs phase transitions:
- vapor ↔ liquid ↔ solid
- humidity
- condensation
- evaporation

It defines how matter moves through phase change
rather than through mechanical transport.


### Soil OS — Biological State
Soil OS governs living circulation:
- microbial activity
- moisture retention
- gas exchange
- organic matter cycling

It defines soil as a dynamic interface
between water, air, and life.


### Wind OS — Pressure State
Wind OS governs pressure differentials:
- air movement
- heat transport
- humidity dispersion

It defines wind as an emergent state
created by spatial imbalance, not generation.


### Fire OS — Combustion State
Fire OS governs chain reactions:
- fuel
- oxygen
- heat

It defines combustion as a deterministic state
that can be structurally interrupted.


### Thunder OS — Fluctuation State
Thunder OS governs variation:
- vibration
- shock
- displacement
- electromagnetic change

It defines energy as something already present
in fluctuating form.

## Inter-OS Relationships

The OSs interact through shared conditions,
not through command or control.

Examples:

- Water OS ↔ Soil OS  
  Moisture conditions define biological activity.

- Wind OS ↔ Water OS  
  Air movement defines evaporation and condensation.

- Wind OS ↔ Fire OS  
  Oxygen availability defines combustion persistence.

- Fire OS ↔ Thunder OS  
  Heat gradients and sudden release generate fluctuation.

- Thunder OS ↔ Water OS  
  Energy gradients drive phase change.

These relationships are **bidirectional** but **non-mandatory**.


---

## No Central Controller

There is no master OS.

Gokan OS has:
- no central scheduler
- no global optimization function
- no required synchronization

Each OS:
- observes local state
- responds to local conditions
- contributes to circulation indirectly


---

## Partial Deployment

Any OS can be deployed alone.

Examples:
- A Water OS implementation without Soil OS
- A Fire OS design in isolation
- A Thunder OS node embedded in existing infrastructure

Partial deployment is valid.
Circulation does not require completeness.


---

## Failure Containment

Because OSs are independent:
- failure does not cascade globally
- local disruption remains local
- recovery paths are multiple

This mirrors natural systems,
where circulation adapts rather than collapses.


---

## Reading the Map

This map should not be read as a diagram of control.

It should be read as:
- overlapping loops
- shared boundaries
- interacting states

The purpose is orientation, not instruction.


---

## Closing

Gokan OS is not a blueprint.

It is a way to locate systems
within a shared circulatory context.

Understanding the map
is the first step to designing responsibly.

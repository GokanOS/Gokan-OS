# Gokan OS — Overview

Gokan OS (五環) is an open design framework for re-architecting planetary-scale infrastructure  
as a **single circulatory system**.

It does not propose a product, a policy, or a prediction.  
It provides a **shared coordinate system** for thinking about how fragmented systems can be reconnected.

This document offers a conceptual overview of Gokan OS:  
its motivation, structure, and how its components relate to one another.

## Why Gokan OS Exists

Modern civilization treats fundamental elements such as:

- water
- soil
- air
- energy
- fire
- human activity

as **separate optimization problems**.

Each domain is managed, optimized, and controlled independently.  
This approach has produced efficiency in isolated contexts, but it has also resulted in:

- broken circulation
- hidden externalities
- brittle systems
- cascading failures

Gokan OS starts from a different premise:

> The world is not a collection of isolated systems.  
> It is a set of interconnected states forming a single circulation.

---

## A Shift in Perspective

Gokan OS reframes infrastructure:

- not as assets to control
- not as resources to extract
- not as problems to solve

but as **states to connect**.

The goal is not maximum efficiency within a single domain,  
but **continuity and stability across the entire system**.

This requires thinking in terms of:
- conditions instead of commands
- circulation instead of control
- state transitions instead of events

## The Five OS Layers

Gokan OS consists of five independent but interoperable operating systems.
Each OS can exist on its own, but is designed to connect with the others.

### Water OS
Focuses on water as a **phase-changing information medium**.  
Addresses circulation through humidity, evaporation, pressure differentials, and condensation.

### Soil OS
Treats soil as a **living circulatory layer**, not a static material.  
Focuses on restoring conditions for autonomous microbial regeneration.

### Wind OS
Defines wind as a **state emerging from pressure differences**, not something to be generated.  
Focuses on air, heat, and humidity circulation at architectural and urban scales.

### Fire OS
Reframes combustion as a **chain state** created by connected conditions.  
Focuses on preventing unsafe persistence of those connections.

### Thunder OS
Redefines energy as **ambient fluctuation** rather than centralized generation.  
Focuses on vibration, shock, displacement, and electromagnetic variation.

## Independence and Connection

Each OS is:

- fully independent
- locally implementable
- complete on its own terms

Connections between OSs are:
- intentional
- explicit
- non-prescriptive

Gokan OS does not enforce a single integration pattern.  
It allows systems to connect where meaningful, and remain separate where necessary.

---

## Design Constraints

Gokan OS deliberately limits itself to:

- fundamental physical principles
- existing or well-understood phenomena
- non-speculative assumptions

It avoids:
- proprietary technologies
- closed standards
- centralized control structures

This makes the framework adaptable across cultures, regions, and scales.

---

## Open Design Framework

All Gokan OS materials are published openly.

There are:
- no patents
- no exclusive licenses
- no gatekeepers

Anyone may:
- study the designs
- implement partial systems
- adapt concepts to local contexts
- extend the framework

## How to Use This Repository

This repository acts as a **structural index**, not a full implementation.

You may use it to:
- navigate the overall system
- link implementations
- propose extensions
- coordinate derivative work

Primary reference materials are hosted externally (OSF, NotebookLM, Notion).

---

## A Note on Interpretation

Gokan OS is not meant to be “fully understood” at once.

Partial understanding is expected.
Questions are part of the system.
Misalignment reveals where circulation is missing.

If something feels unclear, that uncertainty itself is useful.

---

## Closing Thought

Gokan OS does not claim to save the world.

It proposes a way to **see it differently**.

If civilization is stuck,  
perhaps the problem is not lack of technology,  
but lack of shared coordinates.

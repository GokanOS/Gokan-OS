# Gokan OS — Core Principles

This document describes the core design principles of Gokan OS.

These principles are not rules to enforce,
but lenses through which systems can be observed, reframed, and reconnected.

Gokan OS does not prescribe outcomes.
It provides coordinates for thinking.

## 1. Circulation over Control

Modern systems are designed to control resources.

Gokan OS is designed to restore circulation.

Control assumes:
- centralized authority
- fixed targets
- predictable behavior

Circulation assumes:
- distributed states
- continuous feedback
- adaptive behavior

Gokan OS prioritizes sustaining flows over enforcing outcomes.

## 2. States over Resources

Conventional infrastructure treats elements as resources to extract, store, and optimize.

Gokan OS treats elements as **states** that transition and interact.

Water is not a resource.
It is a phase-changing state.

Soil is not a material.
It is a living state.

Energy is not a commodity.
It is fluctuation within a system.

Design begins by identifying states and their transitions,
not by allocating resources.


---

## 3. Conditions over Commands

Most systems rely on commands:
- inputs
- controls
- interventions

Gokan OS designs **conditions** instead.

If conditions are stable,
desired behavior emerges without continuous intervention.

The role of design is not to issue commands,
but to shape the environment in which states connect or remain separated.


---

## 4. Separation Prevents Collapse

Many failures occur not because elements exist,
but because incompatible states become connected.

Fire occurs when:
- fuel
- oxygen
- heat

are connected simultaneously.

Gokan OS focuses on **structural separation**:
designing systems where unsafe connections cannot persist.

Safety is treated as a structural property,
not a reactive response.


---

## 5. Independence with Intentional Connection

Each OS within Gokan OS is fully independent:
- Water OS
- Soil OS
- Wind OS
- Fire OS
- Thunder OS

No OS depends on another to function.

Connections between OSs are:
- intentional
- explicit
- non-prescriptive

This prevents cascading failures
and allows localized implementation without global coordination.


---

## 6. Distributed over Centralized Design

Gokan OS rejects the assumption that optimization requires centralization.

Instead, it assumes:
- local intelligence
- distributed adaptation
- partial deployment

Systems should remain meaningful even when incomplete.

A single node matters.
A single loop can circulate.


---

## 7. Reframing Problems, Not Solving Them

Gokan OS does not aim to "solve" problems directly.

It reframes problems by changing:
- what is considered a variable
- what is considered a boundary
- what is considered a failure

When a problem is reframed correctly,
many conventional solutions become unnecessary.


---

## 8. No Proprietary Assumptions

Gokan OS relies only on:
- fundamental physical principles
- observable environmental behavior

It assumes no proprietary technology,
no speculative physics,
and no exclusive implementation rights.

The framework must remain implementable
with existing or locally available means.


---

## 9. Open by Design

Gokan OS is open by necessity, not ideology.

A closed framework cannot describe open circulation.

Therefore:
- no patents
- no ownership of implementations
- no central authority

Anyone may interpret, adapt, or extend the framework.


---

## Final Note

These principles are not a checklist.

They are reference points.

If a design feels forced,
return to circulation.

If a system feels brittle,
examine its separations.

If implementation feels complex,
revisit the states.
